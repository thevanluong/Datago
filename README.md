## 1. General information
The concept was originally designed by Micaela Crespo from the University of Lausanne, the logic tree and original answer sheets in English were developed by Pablo Diaz from the University of Lausanne.
The original source code for this tool was developed by Thomas Henkel of the Cantonal and University Library of Fribourg. It has been reused and modified for Datago by Thé Van Luong from the University of Lausanne

If you have any questions or comments about Datapago, you can write to us at open.access@unil.ch. In addition, if you encounter an error or malfunction, do not hesitate to report it to us.

## 2. Collaborators
This project was strongly inspired by the tool on the Rights and Obligations of Researchers to Distribute their Publications in Open Access developed by the Lausanne University, Papago.

## 3. Description
Dadago is an online questionnaire that brings together in one place all the essential information on the data management of your research materials. Based on the answers provided by the respondents, it makes it possible to build a personalized scenario, adapted to the researcher's situation.


### Structure

Dapago is composed of 2 complementary parts:

- A form that provides customized scenarios based on the answers to the questions with a final summary of the respondent's situation.
- Sheets in PDF format, accessible by a link at the end of the form, which make it possible to detail the guarantor's situation and his or her rights, obligations and financing opportunities. 

### Logic tree (flowchart)
The flowchart can be broken down into 2 phases (these two phases are transparent to the respondent):

- Phase 1 focuses on the source of funding and includes at least 2 questions regardless of the answer to the first question. The sponsor must indicate whether its publication has been publicly funded. If so, it must indicate the origin of this funding. If the respondent's publication is the result of an H2020 research project, he or she must indicate whether the project began before or after January 1, 2017. If his publication is not the result of a project that has been specifically funded, he must indicate whether at least half of his salary comes from public funds.
- Phase 2 is about publication: the respondent must indicate whether the publication is distributed under a Creative Commons license or on a paid basis. If the respondent's publication is from an H2020 research project, he or she must indicate whether the publication is already being distributed from an open archive. This makes it possible to know if they must take additional steps to meet their obligations.

### Multilingual support
The client and PDF files of Datago are fully available in DE and FR.
